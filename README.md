# Automated Code Generator & Enhancer

## Overview
This project implements a **Generative AI tool** designed to automate the process of code generation based on user requirements. The tool takes user input in natural language, processes it using the **Google Gemini API**, and outputs optimized, functional code in multiple programming languages. This solution aims to save developers significant time during the development process by generating, enhancing, and explaining code automatically, ensuring adherence to best practices and scalability.

## Features
1. **Code Generation:** 
   - Input software requirements in natural language.
   - Generate optimized, error-free code for various programming languages such as **Python**, **Java**, **C++**, **JavaScript**, and **Go**.
   
2. **Code Enhancement:**
   - Provide an existing code snippet.
   - Automatically optimize the code for performance, readability, and adherence to best practices.

3. **Code Explanation:**
   - Input a code snippet, and the tool provides a detailed explanation, making it easier to understand what the code does and why certain design decisions were made.

4. **GitHub Integration:**
   - Push generated or enhanced code directly to a GitHub repository for seamless version control.

5. **Collaborative Coding:**
   - Generate a collaborative link to allow multiple users to work on the code together.

## Key Technologies
- **Python**: Backend implementation and code execution.
- **Streamlit**: User interface for interacting with the tool.
- **Google Gemini API**: Used for natural language processing and code generation.
- **GitHub API**: Integrated for seamless code repository management.

## Workflow
1. **Input Requirements**: Users can provide software requirements or code snippets.
2. **AI Code Generation**: The AI tool processes the input and generates efficient code.
3. **Enhancements & Explanation**: Users can request code optimization or explanations for existing code.
4. **Test & Push to GitHub**: The tool allows testing of the generated code (Python) and provides GitHub integration for pushing the code to a repository.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and install the required dependencies.
2. Set up environment variables for `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
3. Run the Streamlit app locally using the command:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Choose an action (Code Generation, Code Enhancement, Code Explanation) from the dropdown and enter the necessary inputs.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for executing code in additional programming languages beyond Python.
- Integration with more advanced code analysis tools for deeper code testing.
