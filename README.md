## Overview
The **Automated Code Generator & Enhancer** is a cutting-edge tool designed to streamline software development by automating code generation, enhancement, and explanation based on user inputs in natural language. Leveraging the **Google Gemini API**, this tool generates optimized, functional code across multiple programming languages, reducing developer effort and ensuring adherence to best practices. This solution is geared towards saving time in the development process by providing AI-driven code generation, enhancement, and clear explanations of code functionality.

## Features
1. **Code Generation**  
   - Accepts user-defined software requirements in natural language.
   - Generates optimized, scalable, and error-free code in various programming languages including **Python**, **Java**, **C++**, **JavaScript**, and **Go**.
   
2. **Code Enhancement**  
   - Enhances existing code by optimizing it for performance, readability, and error-free execution.
   - Ensures adherence to industry best practices and coding standards.
   
3. **Code Explanation**  
   - Provides clear, concise explanations of code snippets, explaining functionality and design decisions.
   - Useful for educational purposes or when reviewing unfamiliar code.
   
4. **GitHub Integration**  
   - Allows generated or enhanced code to be pushed directly to a GitHub repository, facilitating seamless version control and collaboration.

5. **Collaborative Coding**  
   - Enables the generation of collaborative work links for multiple users to interact and work on code in real time.

## Key Technologies
- **Python**: Backend implementation and execution environment for the tool.
- **Streamlit**: Used to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the AI tool.
- **Google Gemini API**: Powers the natural language processing and code generation functionalities.
- **GitHub API**: Facilitates integration with GitHub for managing and storing code.

## Workflow
1. **Input Requirements**: Users provide software requirements or code snippets in natural language.
2. **AI Code Generation**: The AI processes the input and generates efficient code in the chosen language.
3. **Enhancement & Explanation**: Users can opt to enhance an existing code snippet or request an explanation of the code's functionality.
4. **Testing & GitHub Integration**: The tool supports Python code execution and allows users to push code directly to GitHub.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
2. Create a `.env` file to store your API keys:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
   GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app using the command:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Select your desired action (Code Generation, Code Enhancement, or Code Explanation) and provide the necessary inputs.

## Future Enhancements
- Expanding support to execute and test code in languages beyond Python.
- Integration with advanced code testing and analysis tools to further improve code quality and error detection.
- Implementing more collaboration features, such as live code editing.
